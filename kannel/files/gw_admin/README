## Bootstrap instructions.
    On cloning the repo onto a fresh server.
    cd into it ("it" being the directory you elected to clone into) and run:
        . gw
        install_gw
    This shall first ask you for your preferred gateway_name, please provide it.
    The gateway admin functions and functionality shall then be loaded into your
    environment while also having your .bashrc edited to have this happen each time
    you log in as the current user.

## To start the gateway:
    systemctl start bearerbox smsbox sqlbox

    Individual boxes can be started on their own by specifying each box in turn
    with the systemctl start command.

## To stop the gateway:
    systemctl stop bearerbox smsbox sqlbox

    Individual boxes can be stopped on their own by specifying each box in turn
    with the systemctl stop command.
